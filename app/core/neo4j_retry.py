    Execute Neo4j operation with exponential backoff for transient failures.

    CRITICAL: Only retries on TransientError or ServiceUnavailable.
    Does NOT retry on other exceptions (security, validation, etc.).

    Error categories:
    - TransientError: Network blip, lock contention → RETRY
    - ServiceUnavailable: Temporary cluster issue → RETRY
    - Other exceptions: Code bug, validation failure → FAIL FAST

    Args:
        operation: Async callable to execute (e.g., neo4j_repo.execute_write(...))
        max_retries: Maximum retry attempts (3 = 4 total attempts)
        initial_delay: Initial backoff delay in seconds (0.5 = 500ms)

    Returns:
        Result of operation if successful

    Raises:
        TransientError: If operation fails after max_retries
        Any other exception: Raised immediately (no retry)

    Example:
        result = await retry_neo4j_operation(
            lambda: neo4j_repo.execute_write(query, params)
        )
